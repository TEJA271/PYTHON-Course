1.Write a program that will ask the user for their height in centimeters. Use the input() built-in function to do this. If the height is more than 185 centimeters, execute the program.

height = int(input("Please enter your height in centimeters: "))

if height > 185:
    print("You are taller than 185 cm!")






2.Write a program that will ask the user the following question:
Is Sydney the capital of Australia?
If the user answers y, print: Wrong! Canberra is the capital!
If the user answers n, print: Correct!
If the user answers anything else, print: I do not understand your answer!

answer = input("Is Sydney the capital of Australia? (y/n): ")

if answer.lower() == 'y':
    print("Wrong! Canberra is the capital!")
elif answer.lower() == 'n':
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print("I do not understand your answer!")





3.Write a program to ask the user to do the following:
Provide the name of a country that does not contain any lowercase a or e letters. (Use the prompt: The country is: )
If the user provides a correct string (i.e. one with no a or e inside it), print: You won... unless you made this name up!
Otherwise, print: You lost!


country = input("The country is: ")

# Check if the name contains 'a' or 'e'
if 'a' in country or 'e' in country:
    print("You lost!")
else:
    print("You won... unless you made this name up!")















4. A leap year is a year that consists of 366 (not 365) days. It occurs roughly every four years. More specifically, a year is considered leap if it is either divisible by 4 but not by 100 or it is divisible by 400.
Write a program that asks the user for a year and replies with either leap year or not a leap year.






year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check leap year conditions
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not a leap year")
















5.Write a program that asks for a positive integer and prints all of its divisors, one by one, on separate lines in ascending order.A divisor is a number that divides a particular number with no remainder. For example, the divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.

number = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

# Check if the input is positive
if number <= 0:
    print("That is not a positive integer.")
else:
    print(f"Divisors of {number}:")
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            print(i)












6.Write a Python function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and lower case letters.
Sample String : 'The quick Brow Fox'
Expected Output :
No. of Upper case characters : 3
No. of Lower case Characters : 12





def count_case_letters(s):
    upper_count = sum(1 for char in s if char.isupper())
    lower_count = sum(1 for char in s if char.islower())
    
    print("No. of Upper case characters :", upper_count)
    print("No. of Lower case Characters :", lower_count)

sample_string = 'The quick Brow Fox'
count_case_letters(sample_string)











7.Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.



def is_perfect_number(n):
    return n == sum(i for i in range(1, n) if n % i == 0)

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"{number} is a Perfect number." if is_perfect_number(number) else f"{number} is not a Perfect number.")











8.Write a Python function to find the maximum of three numbers.

def find_max(a, b, c):
    return max(a, b, c)

# Sample usage
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

print("The maximum number is:", find_max(num1, num2, num3))
















9.Write a Python program to reverse a string


print(input("Enter a string: ")[::-1])







10.Write a Python function to check whether a number falls within a given range

# Check if a number is within a range
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
start_range = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
end_range = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))

print(start_range <= num <= end_range)
